// TODO: Need to come up with some central location to handle directory changes from
//       with some safeguards in place.  Have encountered a bunch of issues while testing
//       the lib that stemmed from exec commands being executed from the wrong directory
//       and the codebase is littered with process.chdirs in kind of random places.
